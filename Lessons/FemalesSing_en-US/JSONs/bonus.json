  "Content": "For students who finish early/ want to explore on their own at home, there is a code hidden in the lesson title. Decoding it will require them to gain new tech skills. It also gives them a glimpse at a huge realm of knowledge (binary and hexadecimal encoding of data), though they don’t need to fully understand it to solve the problem.\n\nAt the end of the worksheet, students can optionally learn to translate a hexadecimal code into a web address. Hexadecimals (hex) are a system for encoding information in computers. Search for a “hex to text converter.” Translate the Task # on the front page to get a secret web link.\n\nThis is a fun “tech-savviness/independence” growth activity. Students are asked to dive into a complex topic (hexadecimal encoding/decoding of text) without much support. But it’s actually not that hard. The goal is to encourage all students to not shut down when something sounds complicated and to learn how to think creatively and use the power of the web to their benefit.\n\nThey should do a web search for “hex to text converter”\n\n1. The first hit is likely: http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/hexadecimal/, but almost any will work\n2. They have to type or cut and paste “6269742e6c792f6770686935” from the title page into the “Input Data” field\n3. Choose “Hex to Text” to decode (the example converter defaults to encoding Text to Hex)\n4. You “magically” get bit.ly/gphi5\n5. If the student then copies/types that web address into the address bar, it will result in:\n6. ![a cat gif](https://bit.ly/gphi5)",
