If you enjoy this lesson, please let us know–we want your feedback! This is the first of many, many Galactic Polymath lessons. Feel free to tag me ([@mattwilkinsbio](https://twitter.com/mattwilkinsbio)) and GP ([@galacticPM](https://twitter.com/galacticPM)) on Twitter with your experiences and student questions!
