The Polymath Puzzle in Part 1 draws students into decoding the labels on a graph in order to engage them in trying to understand the next level of meaning in the graph, creating a rich data literacy learning experience. In the first step, students learn that ciphers are used to make a secret message. We use a simple cipher called an alphabetic shift, where each letter of each word in a message has been shifted a certain number of places (e.g. +1 would mean A becomes B, B becomes C, and so on).\nThis section works on assimilating new vocabulary, as well as encouraging students to have a growth mindset. They need to quickly orient themselves to the \"system\" of ciphers and how they work. Parts 2 and 3 of the lesson will build on this engagement hook.",

This is self-fulfilling, as females often look similar to males, sing much less in total & only sing early in the breeding season.\n- This is a form of confirmation bias (though we don’t introduce that term), where we may latch onto evidence that confirms our preexisting assumptions. \n- The scatter plot was a better visualization for this data because it shows the timing of song and when scientists need to focus study of female song to address this gap in our knowledge."
