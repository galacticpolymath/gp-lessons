LearningSummary: Students will learn how data visuals tell a story. They will analyze
  real bird song data to try to understand why female singing behavior has been overlooked
  in one of the most common birds in the world. They will also gain a deeper insight
  into the scientific peer review process.
DrivingQ: What is the best way to visualize data?
EssentialQ: |-
  1. How do our assumptions (biases) affect our conclusions?
  2. What are the pros and cons of scatterplots vs. histograms?
Hooks: This lesson focuses a lot on puzzles called ciphers and uses a goofy video
  showing connections between histograms and dot plots to engage students.

Description: |-
  This lesson teaches students about data visualization (how to read and interpret scatter plots, dot plots, and histograms), and connects to a broader theme of how our assumptions affect our conclusions. Students learn how scientists and birders alike have assumed for decades that most female birds don't sing. As students explore real data from a recent study, they will learn how this assumption could be reinforced by the fact that females sing much less than males, and further, how this biased oversight has limited our understanding of bird research from its very beginnings. [See Scientific Background](#background) for details.

  The lesson will take 3 class periods for most learners. Students dive in with a data literacy puzzle, which we call a “Polymath Puzzle.” Students are given a figure from a current scientific study on barn swallows (a common bird across the world), but with text elements coded with an alphabetic shift (e.g. each letter is shifted: A to B, B to C, and so on). They have to work in teams (or individually) to decipher the messages, and then try to understand the figure. This is a high-level data literacy task that piques students’ natural love of puzzle-solving, while working on GRIT/grappling and the [21st Century Skills (4 Cs)](https://www.aeseducation.com/blog/four-cs-21st-century-skills). Videos guide students through each stage of the Polymath Puzzle. In Parts 2 and 3, students create and interpret histograms from the same data, allowing for a deeper understanding of the pros and cons of scatter plots and histograms for visualizing data patterns. The culminating task is for students to synthesize the conclusions from the two types of graph, along with additional background information to hypothesize a reason for why female song has been missed until 2020 in this widely studied species.
QuickPrep: |-
  1. Check out lesson multimedia below
  2. Look over [Teaching Materials](#teaching_materials)
  3. Teach it and [let us know what you think!](#feedback)
Bonus: |-
  For students who finish early/ want to explore on their own at home, there is a code hidden in the lesson title. Decoding it will require them to gain new tech skills. It also gives them a glimpse at a huge realm of knowledge (binary and hexadecimal encoding of data), though they don’t need to fully understand it to solve the problem.

  At the end of the worksheet, students can optionally learn to translate a hexadecimal code into a web address. Hexadecimals (hex) are a system for encoding information in computers. Search for a “hex to text converter.” Translate the Task # on the front page to get a secret web link.

  This is a fun “tech-savviness/independence” growth activity. Students are asked to dive into a complex topic (hexadecimal encoding/decoding of text) without much support. But it’s actually not that hard. The goal is to encourage all students to not shut down when something sounds complicated and to learn how to think creatively and use the power of the web to their benefit.

  They should do a web search for “hex to text converter”

  1. The first hit is likely: http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/hexadecimal/, but almost any will work
  2. They have to type or cut and paste “6269742e6c792f6770686935” from the title page into the “Input Data” field
  3. Choose “Hex to Text” to decode (the example converter defaults to encoding Text to Hex)
  4. You “magically” get bit.ly/gphi5
  5. If the student then copies/types that web address into the address bar, it will result in:

Background: "![studyThumbnail.png](study-paper.png)\n[Link to the scientific study](https://www.unco.edu/nhs/biology/about-us/benedict-lauryn/documents/publications/Wilkins_et_al_2020.pdf)\n\nThis
  lesson is based on a recent study that describes female song in barn swallows for
  the first time. Barn swallows are one of the most common birds in the world and
  have been the subject of more than 1000 studies, yet published birding field guides
  and scientific papers have all failed to describe female song or they describe it
  incorrectly as being the same as male song (females have their own song type). This
  is an important oversight, because research on male bird song has informed a lot
  of theory in biology about how populations evolve through mate choice and competition
  involving vocal communication, and how new species form. \n\nIgnoring the sounds
  females make may result from inherent biases. Since bird song became an area of
  scientific study in the 1800s, it was almost exclusively researched by white males
  in the Northern Hemisphere. Since women have become welcomed into all areas of science,
  and research institutions have focused more intent study in tropical regions of
  the world, studies have discovered that female song is the ancestral state (i.e.
  the ancestor of all living song birds had both singing males and females). Moreover,
  female song has not been entirely lost in most species. As in the barn swallow,
  natural selection has favored females that sing less often, and to have more concise
  songs that are often restricted to the pre-egg-laying part of the breeding season.
  This drop in female singing after egg-laying is thought to stem from trying not
  to draw predators to nests. Due to lack of study, the full function of song in competition
  among females, male mate choice, or other functions is not well understood in most
  species.\n\nFurther Reading: \n- [Why We Didn't Know That Female Birds Sing](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-it-took-so-long-to-appreciate-female-birds-songs/):

ConnectionToResearch: |-
  This lesson allows students to explore the actual data from [the study](https://www.unco.edu/nhs/biology/about-us/benedict-lauryn/documents/publications/Wilkins_et_al_2020.pdf) and to hear from the study’s lead author to deepen data literacy and understanding of the scientific method. Students explore one of the primary figures in the study, a scatter plot (graph) showing different patterns of male and female singing output over the breeding season. Importantly, males sang much more than females and for a longer time (May-Aug, rather than just May). Thus, because males sing more frequently, if we assume (as has been common for birders and scientists until recently) that only males sing, your assumptions are reinforced more easily, because you are less likely to see a female sing.

  During the peer review process, an anonymous scientist suggested that the scatter plot was not a good way to represent the data, instead suggesting that the authors should have displayed a histogram. In Parts 2 and 3 of the lesson, students aggregate (combine) the authentic study data in order to create a histogram. They must then interpret the data in both formats (deepening their understanding of how histograms and scatter plots relate to each other), and conclude which is a better way to demonstrate the study’s findings, explaining why.

  For further reflection, students are then asked to synthesize what they have learned, along with new information presented to them. Why has female song been missed? Partially because of a pre-existing assumption that females don't sing, along with less common singing behavior in females. Why do females sing less? Because natural selection favors females who sing less. Females must sit on eggs for around 2 weeks, leaving them open to predation. If they were to sing as loudly and provocatively as males, they would attract predators which would eat them or their eggs, passing on no genes. Thus, natural selection has likely caused female song to be lost, simplified, or to be produced for short time periods during establishment of the breeding season in many species around the world.

  engaging and fun! \n>  \n> –11th Grader in Nashville, TN\n\n> I think it looks like
  a very interactive lesson and it will hopefully be engaging and interesting to some
  students. It looks uncomplicated and it gives you all of the resources you will
  ever need for the lesson. The fact that it shows you how to create graphs and diagrams
  in the individual powerpoints is a good attribute in my opinion. \n> -11th Grader
  in Savannah, GA\n  \n> My biggest takeaway from the lesson was the importance of
  choosing the right way to display data...I don’t have any negative feedback…I really
  liked the lesson and appreciated how it was interactive and not just a lecture,
  like many of my online classes have become.\n>  \n> –11th Grader in Nashville, TN"
