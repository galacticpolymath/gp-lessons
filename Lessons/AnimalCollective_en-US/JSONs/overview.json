  "LearningSummary": "Students will draw their own social networks, ponder the meaning of complexity and begin to notice unexpected patterns that emerge around them, unnoticed. Through hands-on activities and digital experiments, students will discover how complexity research enriches our daily lives.",

  "Text": "#### Driving Question(s):\n- Why do humans and other animals live in groups?\n- How do simple behavioral rules lead to *emergence* of novel properties at the group level? (i.e. How do animal flocks, market trends, and viral videos emerge from animal collective behaviors?)\n- How do scientists use computer simulations and other tools to study emergence?\n#### Hook(s):\n- Creative, art-infused \"draw your own social network activity\"\n- Active movement flocking simulation\n- Mind-blowing interactive simulations of fish schooling and social network dynamics",
