LearningSummary: Crystals aren't magic, but they are amazing! In this student-driven,
  lecture-free lesson, students will do card sorts, build hands-on models, solve engineering
  design puzzles, and more! The whole experience is connected through a beautifully
  crafted comic and supporting videos.
DrivingQ: |-
  - What are crystals and how do they form?
  - How is molecular microstructure connected to functionality and properties we can easily observe?
EssentialQ: Why are abstract concepts like geometry important for “real life”?
Hooks: An engaging, original comic weaves together background information, hands-on
  activities, puzzles, and problem sets. Quick videos stoke curiosity and provide
  support for activities.

Background: |
  Crystals occupy a very specific niche in public discourse—especially with the controversy about their supposed powers for magic and healing. Yet these fantastic, naturally occurring materials are truly essential for our lives in many concrete ways. We need many types of crystals to maintain our health, such as salt or iodine. And most of our technology, such as semiconductor chips, depends on the regular structures that atoms form in crystals.
  The discovery of piezoelectric materials in the 1800s further revolutionized our technological devices. Piezos are useful for sensing and actuation, and can sense and deform very precisely. These materials are all around us, but typically their properties are only studied by advanced graduate students in material science, electrical engineering, or physics. At the end of the day, the special features of these amazing materials depend entirely on the (a)symmetry of the crystal structure.

ConnectionToResearch: |-
  Students explore the various ways that scientists study crystals across scales: molecular models, modular unit cells, and bulk solid materials. They learn not only about crystals, but also the value of representing the same information in several ways to learn different things.
  This lesson is also an exploration of symmetry and its importance in nature. Symmetry is what allows crystals to grow, and also what gives them some of their special powers, like the piezoelectric effect! Through video demonstrations and clear worksheet instructions, students are guided through activities in 3D modeling as well as electric dipole calculations to experience how symmetry determines all the properties of a crystal.
