There are misconceptions, misinformation, and misunderstandings about the panther and its habitat, so ecologist and filmmaker Chris Morgan travelled to Florida to get to the bottom of it.",

Here, we learn what happened and how wildlife managers tried to bring them back. Through this story, we explore connected concepts of how habitat fragmentation affects the flow of genes, and how this can lead to increasing risk of extinction in endangered species (the \"Extinction Vortex\"). The video ends with an open-ended question about what common species we could use to study endangered species recovery so that we don't run the chance of inadvertently destroying what we're trying to save.\n\nCheck out the lesson at https://www.galacticpolymath.com/lessons",

      "Content": "#### Connection to Research\n How do we save endangered species? This lesson deals with one option called *genetic rescue*—a conservation strategy that involves moving individuals from one population into an endangered population that is highly inbred in order to add genetic variation to enable population recovery. Students learn about two distinct lines of research: one measuring the success of an attempt to save endangered Florida panthers; the other using wild Trinidadian guppies as a model of endangered species in order to better understand details of how genetic rescue can succeed or fail. \n#### Research Background\n Watch this video for a lot of panther background: [▶ What is genetic rescue, and can we use it to save endangered species?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFQmNq8sJ2Y&list=PLz-D3xOC0d88kLYQLB9xeUz7gAaO1JJZb&index=2)  \n\nThe Florida panther is a unique subspecies (*Puma concolor coryi*) of the American puma (*Puma concolor*). It's not to be confused with black panthers, which are the dark (melanistic) forms of leopards or jaguars. The Florida panther was nearly driven to extinction by habitat loss, fragmentation, and targeted hunting. In the mid-1990s, there remained only a tiny ~20 individual population of panthers in south Florida, and they were highly inbred. They had a lot of recessive genetic abnormalities, including visible, superficial traits like: kinked tails and cowlicks in their fur, to more significant problems like: cryptorchidism (undescended testicles, causing infertility in males) and heart defects. Wildlife managers decided to relocate 8 female pumas from Texas (*Puma concolor couguar*) into Florida to introduce needed genetic variation.  \n\nStudents will get to analyze 20 years worth of monitoring data to assess whether genetic rescue was successful (it was! There are now over 200 Florida panthers). At the same time, students will compare these results to a paired data set in Trinidadian guppies to understand how model organisms can be used to answer scientific questions that are difficult to answer in an endangered or difficult-to-study species.\n\n#### Related Florida Panther Paper:\n![screenshot of panther study paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/gp-cloud/lessons/geneticRescue_sci/VanDeKerk_paper_screenshot.png)\n[Link to study](https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wmon.1041)\n\n\nThis video connects genetic rescue research on Florida panthers to the Trinidadian guppy model species: [▶ Saving a species through genetic rescue: Why we need model organisms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiXyHxv4Sx4&list=PLz-D3xOC0d88kLYQLB9xeUz7gAaO1JJZb&index=3)\n\nTo study many details of genetic rescue in a model system where we don't have to worry about inadvertently driving a species extinct, Dr. Sarah Fitzpatrick and colleagues went to Trinidad. They took advantage of previous experiments that had moved guppies from a downstream population that had lots of genetic variation into upstream pools with only a few, highly inbred fish. \n\nThis genetic rescue experiment was indeed successful, and after only a few months, genetic variation increased and the population rebounded from around 20 individuals to over 1,000.\n\n\n#### Related Guppy Paper:\n![screenshot of Scientific Study](https://storage.googleapis.com/gp-cloud/lessons/geneticRescue_sci/fitzpatrick_paper_screenshot.png)\n[Link to study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.12356)\n\n#### Further Reading\n- [USFWS Florida Panther Profile](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/florida_panther/wah/panther.html)\n- [Nat Geo: Planned roads could imperil Florida's panthers—and last remaining wilderness](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/florida-toll-road-threatens-wildlife-panthers?loggedin=true)\n- [The Florida Panther: Past, Present and Future](https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/publication/UW402)\n- [America’s cat is on the comeback](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/americas-cat-is-on-the-comeback)\n- [Of kings and Alpine Ibex: the amazing resurrection of a species from near-extinction](https://natureecoevocommunity.nature.com/posts/59792-of-kings-and-alpine-ibex-the-amazing-resurrection-of-a-species-from-near-extinction)\n",
