LearningSummary: Students will deepen their understanding of basic genetics concepts
  as they dive into real data sets from ongoing research. They will hone critical
  thinking and communication skills and come away with clear examples of how science
  can lead to positive impacts on wildlife populations.
DrivingQ: Can genetic rescue (a conservation strategy involving movement of individuals
  across populations) prevent the extinction of endangered species?
EssentialQ: How do we use scientific methods to measure and develop solutions for
  our negative impacts on the world?
Hooks: Numerous puzzles, group activities, compelling videos, and active discussions
  draw students into real world problems.
MiscMD: .na
LearningObj: |-
  1. Provide examples of variation in genes, traits, and individual survival, and why each is important for a species to persist and evolve.
  2. Summarize how human activities fragment animal populations and how habitat fragmentation limits gene flow, reducing genetic variation.
  3. Predict how increasing genetic variation by introducing new individuals (i.e. by conducting genetic rescue) will impact population size.
  4. Create a logic model showing how genetic rescue occurs; i.e. how the introduction of new individuals to a small, inbred population on the verge of extinction provides needed genetic variation for the population to survive and recover.
  5. Demonstrate understanding of how reduction in both population size and genetic variation in endangered species lead to the "extinction vortex"—the increasing likelihood of small populations to blink out due to low population size and recessive genetics from inbreeding.
  6. Propose a model organism to use for research on species that are endangered or infeasible to study.
  7. Interpret scatter plot data from a model organism (Trinidadian guppies) and compare to related data in an endangered species (Florida panthers) to draw broader conclusions about the effectiveness of genetic rescue.
  8. Assess the potential risks and benefits of genetic rescue for a particular species, and propose a course of action.

Description: "Students learn about genetic rescue, an approach for helping endangered
  populations recover by introducing closely related individuals from a different
  population. The lesson is framed around the story of Florida panthers, which are
  a classic success story for genetic rescue. In Part 1, students explore Florida
  panther recovery through the lens of different stakeholders (ranchers, city-dwellers,
  and Native Americans), discussing ways that each group may have positive or negative
  associations with panthers. \n\nIn Part 2, they then explore different options for
  helping panther recovery, discussing pros and cons of genetic rescue, captive breeding,
  or doing nothing. \n\nPart 3 provides necessary scaffolding for a deeper dive into
  genetic rescue by explaining key concepts in the context of Florida panthers. Students
  also do a card-based activity simulating matings to better understand why inbreeding
  and recessive traits are so problematic in small populations.\n\nPart 4, goes deeper
  into genetic rescue: what can go wrong? Students provide evidence of their understanding
  of how all the concepts connect through a concept mapping exercise, interspersed
  with our carefully crafted explainer videos. A key take-home is that even though
  genetic rescue worked in Florida panthers, it's quite risky to test out conservation
  strategies on an endangered species. The concluding task is to analyze a table of
  organisms and their characteristics to determine which would be good models to study
  the effectiveness of genetic rescue without risking a rare species' extinction.
  \n\nPart 5 builds on this to reveal Dr. Sarah Fitzpatrick's (this lesson's sponsor)
  research using Trinidadian guppies as a model of genetic rescue. Students then spend
  much of the class period analyzing real, paired data collected from Florida panthers
  and guppies. They are asked to compare and label graphs from both species, and synthesize
  broader conclusions. The lesson leaves open many options for project-based lessons
  and independent projects."

Extensions: One exciting extension could be to have students investigate map data
  of panther car collision mortality events over time. [This incredible interactive
  web tool](https://geodata.myfwc.com/datasets/florida-panther-mortality/explore?filters=eyJEYXRlIjpbMTQ5Mzk2NDkyNzE4OS41NiwxNjA5NTQ1NjAwMDAwXX0%3D&location=26.491578%2C-81.497011%2C12.39)
  would allow students to conduct an independent investigation of the leading cause
  of Florida panther mortality (car crashes). Students could be asked to develop their
  own recommendation for mitigation (a wildlife overpass, increased signage, or decreased
  speed limit) on specific roadways that show high numbers of collisions.
Background: "Watch this video for a lot of panther background: {vid3}  \n\nThe Florida
  panther is a unique subspecies (*Puma concolor coryi*) of the American puma (*Puma
  concolor*). It's not to be confused with black panthers, which are the dark (melanistic)
  forms of leopards or jaguars. The Florida panther was nearly driven to extinction
  by habitat loss, fragmentation, and targeted hunting. In the mid-1990s, there remained
  only a tiny ~20 individual population of panthers in south Florida, and they were
  highly inbred. They had a lot of recessive genetic abnormalities, including visible,
  superficial traits like: kinked tails and cowlicks in their fur, to more significant
  problems like: cryptorchidism (undescended testicles, causing infertility in males)
  and heart defects. Wildlife managers decided to relocate 8 female pumas from Texas
  (*Puma concolor couguar*) into Florida to introduce needed genetic variation.  \n\nStudents
  will get to analyze 20 years worth of monitoring data to assess whether genetic
  rescue was successful (it was! There are now over 200 Florida panthers). At the
  same time, students will compare these results to a paired data set in Trinidadian
  guppies to understand how model organisms can be used to answer scientific questions
  that are difficult to answer in an endangered or difficult-to-study species.\n\n####

  video connects genetic rescue research on Florida panthers to the Trinidadian guppy
  model species: {vid 4}\n\nTo study many details of genetic rescue in a model system
  where we don't have to worry about inadvertently driving a species extinct, Dr.
  Sarah Fitzpatrick and colleagues went to Trinidad. They took advantage of previous
  experiments that had moved guppies from a downstream population that had lots of
  genetic variation into upstream pools with only a few, highly inbred fish. \n\nThis
  genetic rescue experiment was indeed successful, and after only a few months, genetic
  variation increased and the population rebounded from around 20 individuals to over
  1,000.\n\n\n#### Related Guppy Paper:\n![screenshot of Scientific Study](fitzpatrick_paper_screenshot.png)\n[Link

ConnectionToResearch: 'How do we save endangered species? This lesson deals with one
  option called *genetic rescue*—a conservation strategy that involves moving individuals
  from one population into an endangered population that is highly inbred in order
  to add genetic variation to enable population recovery. Students learn about two
  distinct lines of research: one measuring the success of an attempt to save endangered
  Florida panthers; the other using wild Trinidadian guppies as a model of endangered
  species in order to better understand details of how genetic rescue can succeed
  or fail.'
