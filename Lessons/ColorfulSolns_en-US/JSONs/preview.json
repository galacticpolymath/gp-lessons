      "description": "Color is woven so tightly into our lives that we rarely stop to question what it is and how it works. Where do the colors in diamonds and rainbows come from? How have some animals benefited by evolving to stand out, while others survive by blending in? Why do some colors make us happy while others make us, well, blue? The Nature of Color, a new exhibition now open at the American Museum of Natural History reveals how color carries information both in nature and across cultures.",
      "lessonRelevance": "Provides a broad appreciation of color that sets the ground for our unit investigating dye technologies and why they are important.",
