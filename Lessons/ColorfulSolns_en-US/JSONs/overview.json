  "Text": "#### Driving Question(s):\nHow have different dye technologies been used to produce colorful clothing across cultures and over time?\n#### Essential Question(s):\nHow can a career in chemical, genetic, or process engineering create opportunities to solve complex societal problems?\n#### Hook(s):\n- Part 1 begins with a warm-up “Dye-versity Audit,” In which students will quantify the number of dyes they brought to class on their person and reflect on what they mean in terms of self-expression. The rest of Part 1 focuses on narratives designed to appeal to students’ curiosity.\n- Part 2 involves a card-based puzzle activity. \n- Part 3 puts students directly in the decision-maker position, giving them an opportunity to choose a course of action based on their own values and reasoning.",
