LearningSummary: 'Students will identify a problem with an existing product and investigate
  biological functions to inspire a product redesign. Through independent research
  using AI bots and scholarly sources, students will gain a new perspective on STEM,
  biology, and the human interface between. '
DrivingQ: |
  1. How can we use organismal adaptations to design better engineering solutions?
  2. What products in our daily lives could be more sustainable, functional, or aesthetically pleasing?

Background: "This series of lessons comes out of an interdisciplinary collaboration
  of biologists, designers, philosophers and educators at the University of Minnesota.
  The team is led by [Emilie Snell-Rood](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=s-pbFU8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao),
  who holds a BS in Biology, a doctorate in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, and
  is currently faculty in Ecology, Evolution and Behavior at UMN. Emilie’s research
  focuses on understanding responses of organisms to human environments; for instance,
  why some butterflies deal well with urban pollutants and others do not. For the
  last decade, Emilie has been working to improve the biomimetic process, in research
  and the classroom, by facilitating deeper interdisciplinary collaborations between
  biologists, designers and engineers. The current team of biologists, architects
  and philosophers is exploring the development of biological principles used in design
  that are accurate but also spur creative design ideas in addition to developing
  and testing classroom activities in biomimetics. \n\nThis unit and the scientific
  working group that produced it is funded by the John Templeton Foundation's [Agency,
  Directionality & Function research program](https://www.biologicalpurpose.org/).\n\n###

ConnectionToResearch: 'Students will dive into primary resources (e.g. through [Google
  Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)) or journal articles summarizing scientific
  research (depending on student levels), as they investigate current products and
  biological adaptations that could inspire new engineering solutions. '
