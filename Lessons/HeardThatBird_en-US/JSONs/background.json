  "Content": "#### Connection to Research\n In this lesson, students directly follow the footsteps of scientists who are working to better understand bird communication. \n#### Research Background\n Some of our abilities we are born with, and others we learn over time. Like humans, some birds learn to sing and communicate by interacting with others in their community. Nicole Creanzaâ€™s lab looks at how these learned singing behaviors came to be, and how they are evolving over time. Learning more about bird communication helps us to better understand our own human language.",
