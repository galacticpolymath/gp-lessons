LearningSummary: Students will learn how to use spectrograms to visualize and identify
  birds they hear. They will see 3 women bird researchers at different career levels
  model scientific thought processes and leave class excited to use the free Merlin
  app to ID birds outside of class.
DrivingQ: |-
  1. What natural sounds are we missing as we go about our daily lives?
  2. How can spectrograms be used to help us identify birds in the environment?
  3. What can bird sounds teach us about human emotion and communication?
EssentialQ: .na
Hooks: 'Students will compete against bird scientists in a gameshow to identify birds
  in pop culture. Can they beat the experts?! '

Background: Some of our abilities we are born with, and others we learn over time.
  Like humans, some birds learn to sing and communicate by interacting with others
  in their community. Nicole Creanzaâ€™s lab looks at how these learned singing behaviors
  came to be, and how they are evolving over time. Learning more about bird communication
  helps us to better understand our own human language.
ConnectionToResearch: In this lesson, students directly follow the footsteps of scientists
  who are working to better understand bird communication.
