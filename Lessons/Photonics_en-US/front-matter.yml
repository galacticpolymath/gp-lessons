LearningSummary: Embark on a journey through time and space to understand what light
  really is and how humans use it. From starting fires with sunlight to sending messages
  to other planets to current research in photonics, students will become more curious
  about light in their daily lives!
DrivingQ: |-
  1. How can light be used to measure, transmit, and control information?
  2. How does light behave in various mediums?
EssentialQ: |-
  How has human curiosity driven innovation throughout history?
  What are the benefits and challenges of communicating with light?
Hooks: 'Puzzles, hands-on games, and original illustrations create a dynamic lesson
  supported by engaging videos. '

Background: 'Light is everywhere in our daily lives, and not just to help us see -
  from communication technologies like radio and Wi-Fi to X-rays at the dentist, our
  lives depend on the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Nanophotonics studies how light
  waves interact with materials at very small scales, with applications such as semiconductors,
  lasers, and microscopy. '
ConnectionToResearch: Students participate in engineering and design thinking throughout
  the mini-unit, putting themselves in the shoes of early optical engineers, taking
  on design challenges, and developing their own methods to encode wave messages.
  Each lesson spotlights an important photonics application. The lessons build a conceptual
  understanding of how light is a wave, and how light’s many unique properties can
  be shaped with tools to make life better in lots of ways. Lesson 3 will dive deeper
  into how light interacts with materials, including Dr. Folland’s research about
  how light interacts with materials at very small scales.
