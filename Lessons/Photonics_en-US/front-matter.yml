LearningSummary: Embark on a journey through time and space to understand what light
  really is and how humans use it. From starting fires with sunlight to sending messages
  to other planets to current research in photonics, students will become more curious
  about light in their daily lives!
DrivingQ: |-
  1. How can light be used to measure, transmit, and control information?
  2. How does light behave in various mediums?
EssentialQ: |-
  - How has human curiosity driven innovation throughout history?
  - What are the benefits and challenges of communicating with light?
Hooks: 'Puzzles, hands-on games, and original illustrations create a dynamic lesson
  supported by engaging videos. '

Background: "Light is one of the most powerful tools we have for understanding the
  world around us! It helps us see, from visible light to X-rays, and communicate
  via radio technologies— and, light can tell us about what things are made of.\n\nDr.
  Tom Folland studies how light behaves in different materials, and what this behavior
  can tell us about chemical, electrical and other properties of these materials.
  All these properties influence the usefulness of materials to create technologies
  as broad as computer chips, light bulbs, or pollutant sensors. In particular, by
  observing light in crystalline materials, the Folland group is able to observe light
  behaving in new ways, differently from in conventional optical materials like glass.\n\nAn
  example is the *polariton* – which forms when light interacts with a material to
  create a new state of light. It inherits some of the properties of light, but also
  takes on some of the properties of the material it is coupled to. For instance,
  the wavelength of the light can be compressed, or we can make light travel in certain
  directions.\nHere is a selection of summaries and scientific papers about Dr. Folland’s
  work and discipline:\n\n#### Further Reading:\n- [Phys.org | (Summary) Hyperbolic
  shear polaritons in low-symmetry crystals ](https://phys.org/news/2022-02-hyperpolic-polaritons-low-symmetry-crystals.html)\n-
  [Physics Today | (Overview of discipline) Nanophotonics for a sustainable future]
  (https://pubs.aip.org/physicstoday/article/76/6/24/2893165/Nanophotonics-for-a-sustainable-futureAs-the-field)\n-
  [American Chemical Society | (Scientific paper) Narrowband Polaritonic Thermal Emitters
  Driven by Waste Heat] (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsomega.0c00600) "
ConnectionToResearch: 'Students participate in engineering and design thinking throughout
  the mini-unit, putting themselves in the shoes of early optical engineers, taking
  on design challenges, developing their own methods to encode wave messages, and
  learning about important photonics applications. The first two units give a basic
  introduction to the concepts underpinning light, the manipulation of light, and
  how different types of light can be used. The final module will introduce how material
  properties can control light, and how this relates to ongoing technological developments.
  This ties into Dr. Folland’s research about the behavior of light in crystalline
  materials. '
