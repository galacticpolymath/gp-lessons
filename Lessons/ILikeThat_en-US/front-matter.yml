LearningSummary: Students will conduct experiments and analyze real scientific data
  as they *learn about themselves*. They'll learn how our eyes and brains interact
  to determine what we like and dislike, and apply this knowledge to fish research
  and the art of character design.
DrivingQ: |
  1. What makes humans and other animals perceive something as beautiful?
  2. How does the way our brain processes visual input from our eyes affect how we perceive and interact with the world?
EssentialQ: How can science help deepen our understanding of the Arts, Humanities,
  and ourselves?
Hooks: Warm-up puzzles, fun student-driven experiments, and original artwork are woven
  into this data-centered lesson.
MiscMD: .na
LearningObj: |-
  1. Interpret a concept map of how our perception of beauty results from interactions between our brain, sensory systems, and the environment.
  2. Follow the scientific method to conduct a study and test how much our own inherent emotional response and memories affect preferences for visual stimuli.
  3. Interpret histograms, boxplots, and other data visuals to draw conclusions about a data set.
  4. Apply a framework for how our brains process visual signals to artworks.

Description: "This lesson equips students with a simple framework for understanding
  how inputs from our senses are processed in the brain to determine what we like
  vs. dislike and how we behave. Though the lesson focuses on vision, the framework
  applies to all the senses. \n\nIn Part 1, students begin by ranking 10 images based
  on their arbitrary preferences. They then conduct an experiment (taking turns as
  a \"scientist\" and \"subject\") to try and understand *why* they ranked things
  the way they did. This is lesson both involves authentic, novel, science, but should
  also grow students' curiosity and understanding of their own decision-making.\n\nPart
  2 builds on the framework introduced in Part 1 in the context of a real study on
  fish [see Background](#background). Students will analyze box plots (a type of graph
  similar to bar plots) to test whether female darters prefer a model fish painted
  a color that is most stimulating to the sensory cells in their eyes (i.e cones in
  their retinas). Students will reflect on how basic research on fish applies to humans.\n\nPart
  3 perfectly blends art, math, and science by testing whether creatures that have
  proportions outside the range of humans makes them inherently creepy or cute. For
  this lesson, we created an original set of creature designs that have scaled dimensions
  which students will use to collect data and calculate proportions. They will then
  conclude whether having certain proportions (e.g. a large ratio of leg-to-torso-length)
  far above or below the range of humans makes a creature inherently creepy or cute.\n\nCollectively,
  this lesson should leave students with a nuanced understanding of how human (and
  other animal) brains process different sensory stimuli to affect preferences and
  behavior. It's a great starting-off point for deepening interest and engagement
  for independent projects."

  - Have students do independent research on how our sensory sensitivities can bias our decision making. Here are some readings for inspiration:
      - [*Yale News* | With hot coffee, we see a warm heart, Yale researchers find](https://news.yale.edu/2008/10/23/hot-coffee-we-see-warm-heart-yale-researchers-find)
      - [*Neuroscience News* | Pitch of Candidate’s Voice Can Influence Election Outcomes](https://neurosciencenews.com/political-psychology-vocal-tone-2398/)
  - Have your students read the scientific paper that Part 2 is based around ([see Background](#background)), and have them grapple with how the version they experienced in class compares to the complexity of the paper. The goal could be to have them try to extract as much meaning from the paper as possible, while not becoming too frustrated.
Background: "Parts 1 and 3, students will run their own experiments, testing novel
  hypotheses related to their own preferences. For these activities, we developed
  a conceptual framework that is woven into all lesson parts. This framework is explained
  in our video {vid1}. We want students to understand in general terms how our brains
  perceive things detected by our senses, and then incorporate prior experience and
  emotional responses to form preferences that affect their behavior. This is based
  on research in humans and other animals. Though human \"emotions\" can be very complex,
  many animals from primates to bees show a range of positive <-> negative responses
  to stimuli that can be interpreted as emotions. If students are interested in learning
  more about emotions in animals, here are some excellent scientific articles targeted
  at young readers:\n- [*Frontiers for Young Minds* | Animal Emotions–Do Animals Feel
  as We Do?](https://kids.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frym.2021.622811)\n- [*Frontiers
  for Young Minds* | Your Smile Caught My Eye: Why Do Emotional Things Catch and Hold
  Our Attention?](https://kids.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frym.2022.781748)\n\nIn
  Part 2, students will learn about how our eyes detect and process different colors
  (i.e. different wavelengths of light). They learn key background from {vid3} and
  {vid4}. \n\nIn our original video: {vid5}, Drs. Tamra Mendelson and Tory Williams
  talk about their work on darters, a fascinating and beautiful group of fish native
  to North America (see supplementary vid: {vid7}). \n\nIn the scientific study students
  will learn about, the researchers tested whether female darters were most attracted
  to colors that were most stimulating to the sensory cells in their eyes (i.e. cones
  found in the retina). Students will follow in the scientist's footsteps, first making
  predictions and then analyzing their authentic data. The video and presentation
  will guide students through interpreting graphs of sensitivity curves to make their
  predictions. \n\nBasically, there were two models of male fish used to test female
  preferences. They were colored \"red\" and \"orange\" to mimic extremes of natural
  variation. Looking at the graph below, the place where the 2 sensitivity curves
  overlap is the light wavelength that should be most stimulating to females' eyes.
  That is, light that has a wavelength of about 550nm should maximize activation of
  both the medium and long wavelength cone cells in the retina. The question is: do
  females prefer a model with an average reflectance closest to this wavelength? \n\n![Sensitivity
  curves for darters. A dashed line shows medium wavelength cone sensitivity, peaking
  around 580nm, while a solid line shows long wavelength cone sensitivity peaking
  around 580nm. The curves overlap at 550nm. Arrows point to orange model fish, showing
  the peak reflectances of the orange model fish at 570nm and the red model at 584
  nm](darter_vis_sensitivity_curve.png)\n\nThe video and presentation guide students
  through interpreting this graph—to predict that females should prefer the orange
  model. Our video explains the experimental setup, but here it is briefly: Individual
  wild-caught females were put in the middle of a tank which had two tanks on either
  side of it. Model fish simulating extremes of natural variation in male colors were
  placed on either side of the female tank. An observer recorded what proportion of
  time females spent associating with the \"red\" versus the \"orange\" male model.
  Students will observe the patterns in the data and determine that females had a
  strong preference for the orange model. They will then draw conclusions about why
  this research matters more broadly and hopefully begin to wonder--how are our daily
  decisions affected by our sensitivity to different stimuli? This could be a great
  jumping-off point for independent research/PBLs. [See Extensions](#extensions)\n\n![Cover

ConnectionToResearch: 'In this three-part lesson, students will follow in the footsteps
  of scientists (analyzing real, published data), but also conduct their own novel
  experiments. Overall, our hope is that students will recognize that science and
  data are everywhere and give us insight into ourselves. '
