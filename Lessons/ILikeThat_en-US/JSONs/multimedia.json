    "description": "This video explores how things we see (visual stimuli) affect emotional states and interact with our memories and higher order thinking (cognition) to produce preferences and behavior. This basic framework is adapted from human and animal behavior research. We use this framework throughout the middle school-targeted lesson below. In the lesson, students perform an experiment to understand their own preferences and dive into research on fish, exploring how sensitivity to different frequencies of light affects mate preferences. We dive into this topic in detail in our second video supporting this lesson.",
    "lessonRelevance": "Sets up an experiment students will run on themselves to understand how emotion, memory, and higher-order connections explain their own preferences.",
