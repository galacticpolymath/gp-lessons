LearningSummary: Out of 8,000+ frog species, Guardian Frogs are one of the first to
  show females that call & males that care for offspring. Students will gain wonder
  and appreciation for how diverse animal mating systems are while doing fun activities
  and analyzing real data.
DrivingQ: |-
  - Across animal species, is there truth to the stereotype that males are “competitive,” while females are “caring”, or is this an oversimplification?
  - Are the smooth guardian frogs of Borneo the first known species of frog with “competitive females” and “caring males”?
EssentialQ: |-
  - How can we use scientific methods to identify a general pattern?
  - Why do exceptions matter in science and in life?

LearningObj: |
  1. Explain how animal behavior facilitates survival and reproduction.
  2. Collect, reorganize, and analyze data to identify a pattern (that males tend to have adaptations to compete for mates, while females provide more parental care), and interpret exceptions to that pattern.
  3. Learn to test hypotheses by interpreting authentic scientific graphs and data.
  4. Understand that there is always variability in scientific data.
  5. Cite evidence to support explanatory claims.
  6. Integrate multiple lines of evidence to explain why biological exceptions matter to science and society.

Description: "This lesson puts students in the role of scientists, collecting and
  analyzing real data to answer questions. In Part 1, students \"collect\" data through
  a card-based activity called \"Role With It.\" Briefly, students get a male or female
  card of 1 out of 12 species. When their card is called, students introduce it with
  a \"song\" and dance that match the attributes of the species it represents. The
  class then records data on sexual signal exaggeration and parental investment for
  that species. \n\nOnce they have collected all 24 specimens (cards) students analyze
  this data (for Part 2) to generate a general observation: \"across nonhuman animal
  species, females tend to be more caring (contributing more parental investment),
  while males tend to be more adapted to attracting and competing for mates.\" These
  are known as *conventional sex roles.* Students then identify *sex-role-reversed
  species,* such as jacanas (a bird) and guardian frogs, which have \"caring males\"
  and \"competitive females\".\n\nPart 3 lets students use real data to test whether
  the Smooth Guardian Frog (*Limnonectes palavenensis*) is truly the first known sex-role-reversed
  frog species, with \"caring males\" and \"competitive females\". The lesson begins
  with an atmospheric video that immerses students in the sights, sounds, and mysteries
  of the island of Borneo. Students are then given a brief introduction to the geography
  of the region and learn that Borneo is claimed by three Asian countries (Malaysia,
  Indonesia and Brunei). The rest of the lesson focuses on Dr. Johana Goyes Vallejos'
  research in the forests of Brunei. Students test hypotheses by synthesizing information
  and analyzing a scatter plot to determine that this fascinating species is indeed
  the first frog known to have \"caring males\" and \"competitive females.\" \n\nThe
  lesson offers a wide variety of opportunities for student movement, collaboration,
  creativity, and active engagement.\n"

Background: "Watch {vid3} to get a nice summary of Dr. Johana Goyes Vallejos’ scientific
  journey.\n\nWhile pursuing a PhD in ecology and evolutionary biology at the University
  of Connecticut, Johana heard about a poorly studied frog called the Smooth Guardian
  Frog (*Limnonectes palavanensis*), found only on the island of Borneo in Southeast
  Asia. In a couple of scientific papers in the 1980s, a researcher had described
  a highly unusual behavior--the males guard eggs hidden under the leaf litter (thus,
  the common name of the species). When the eggs hatch, the male then carries the
  tadpoles (on his back!) to small pools of water where they can develop into adult
  frogs.\nJohana, who was deeply interested in parental care behavior decided to fly
  to the tiny sultanate of Brunei (ruled by a sultan, rather than a king) and learn
  about this frog herself. She established a study population, tracking individuals
  and recording audio of frog calls, often on her own at night, wading through thick
  mud and fording streams. During her observations, she noticed a tiny peep. It sounded
  very different from the male calls she had been used to hearing. After careful observation,
  she confirmed that indeed, these were female calls, which had never been described
  before by anyone. (See {vid4})\n\nOut of 8,000+ known frog species, Johana had found
  one of only a couple that are known to have calling females. Previously, scientists
  had thought females might be physiologically incapable of producing calls. In contrast,
  when she started focusing on female calling behavior, she found that they were actually
  calling *more* than males! Students will recapitulate this finding by analyzing
  a figure showing male and female calling rates.\n\nAs [Borneo is now being heavily
  deforested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_in_Borneo), populations
  of Guardian Frogs are declining. In the final assignment, students are asked to
  synthesize everything they’ve learned to write a persuasive paragraph about why
  these exceptional frogs matter and what we stand to lose if they are lost. \n\n####
  Researcher Bio\nDr. Johana Goyes Vallejos is a Preparing Future Faculty for Faculty
  Diversity Postdoctoral Fellow in the Division of Biological Sciences at the University
  of Missouri, Columbia. She graduated with a B.Sc. in Biology with a minor in Genetics
  from the Universidad del Valle in Cali, Colombia. She received her Ph.D. in Ecology
  and Evolutionary Biology from the\nUniversity of Connecticut, studying mating systems,
  parental care behavior, and acoustic\ncommunication in frogs. Her research has taken
  her to many tropical forests across the\nworld, including Panama, Costa Rica, Guyana,
  the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei\nDarussalam. \n\nAt the University of Missouri,
  Dr. Goyes Vallejos continues her research on\nmating behavior and parental care
  strategies using frogs with elaborate parental behaviors\nas study systems. In addition,
  since 2018, she serves as a research mentor for an NSF-\nfunded Research Experience
  for Undergraduates program in Costa Rica, providing\nhands-on training in animal
  behavior and field research to undergraduate students\nbelonging to minoritized
  groups in STEM. She is passionate about sharing her research findings with scientific
  and non-scientific audiences through various media outlets. When not chasing frogs
  in remote forests around the world Dr. Goyes Vallejos enjoys salsa dancing, storytelling
  and crocheting amigurumis. \n\n[Learn more about Johana at her website](https://jogoyesvallejos.weebly.com/)\n\n####

ConnectionToResearch: "Instead of telling students that a pattern exists, we have
  them discover it for themselves. That is, rather than telling them, \"In animal
  species with *conventional sex roles,* males invest more in attracting and competing
  for mates, while females invest more in parental care,\" we have students collect
  data in a fun, interactive format and draw this conclusion from the data. They are
  then more invested in understanding cases of *sex role reversed species* that are
  the exceptions to this rule, and have \"caring males\" and \"competitive females.\"
  \n\nIn part 2, students follow in the footsteps of an early career Latina scientist,
  Dr. Johana Goyes Vallejos, testing the same hypotheses she did during her PhD research.
  Students analyze a real graph and table she collected on the island of Borneo to
  determine if the Smooth Guardian Frog (*Limnonectes palavanensis*) is the first
  sex-role-reversed frog species known to science. (It is!)"
