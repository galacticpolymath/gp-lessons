      "description": "Dr. Johana Goyes-Vallejos discovers that in the smooth guardian frog of Borneo, female frogs call. In frog species, typically male frogs call, while females stay silent. Dr. Johana Goyes-Vallejos shows that in the smooth guardian frog of Borneo (Limnonectes palavanensis) this is not the case and that female frogs call, too, producing spontaneous vocalizations to attract males. Dr. Goyes-Vallejosâ€™ discovery that female frogs call suggests that L. palavanensis exhibits a reversal in calling behavior and possibly a sex-role-reversed mating system, which would be the first ever observed in a frog species.",
      "lessonRelevance": "We show parts of this video to introduce students to Dr. Goyes-Vallejos and her research. They will then analyze some of her data.",
