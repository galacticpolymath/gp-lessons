Each card has provided sexual signal values (from 0 to 3) for visual and acoustic (sound) traits. Zero means a specimen doesn't have that type of signal; 3 means that sex of that species has a very exaggerated trait. Students will build a dataset of relative sexual signal elaboration (e.g. how fancy the feathers and songs are) and parental investment for each sex across 12 different species.\n\nThe presentation guides the game. When a specimen's common name is called, the student with that card must stand up and introduce it. They will repeat their name 3-5 times at a volume corresponding to the Acoustic Signal Score on their card. Simultaneously, they will do a dance that is at the level of the Visual Display Score on their card. \n\nAfter the introduction, the student will read for their classmates the Parental Investment information on the card.
