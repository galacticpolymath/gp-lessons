LearningSummary: Students will learn to think like chemical engineers as they delve
  into the dye technologies that allow us to express ourselves through colourful clothing.
  They will read and discuss complex texts, analyse concept maps and graphs, and develop
  an appreciation for indigenous (Māori) dye technology.
DrivingQ: How have different dye technologies been used to produce colorful clothing
  across cultures and over time?
EssentialQ: How can a career in chemical, genetic, or process engineering create opportunities
  to solve complex societal problems?
Hooks: "- Part 1 begins with a warm-up “Dye-versity Audit,” In which students will
  quantify the number of dyes they brought to class on their person and reflect on
  what they mean in terms of self-expression. The rest of Part 1 focuses on narratives
  designed to appeal to students’ curiosity.\n- Part 2 involves a card-based puzzle
  activity. \n- Part 3 puts students directly in the decision-maker position, giving
  them an opportunity to choose a course of action based on their own values and reasoning."
MiscMD: .na
LearningObj: |-
  1. Understand that chemical engineers develop economical commercial processes to convert raw material into useful products.
  2. Compare and contrast the costs and benefits of synthetic vs natural dye production.
  3. Interpret graphs to assess how prices for different technologies change with production scale.

Description: "Students will gain a deep appreciation for the technology behind the
  colours we use to express ourselves in our everyday dress. This lesson offers a
  brief but deep dive into chemical engineering through the lens of dye technology.
  There are 3 parts, each expected to take about one 45-minute class period. \n\nPart
  1 is a “student expert\" / [\"jigsaw\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigsaw_(teaching_technique))
  activity, where student groups number off into 3 subgroups. Each subgroup will read
  an article about a dye technology, fill out a concept map to understand the chemical
  process described, and teach this process to their group mates. The three technologies
  students will learn about are: Tyrian Purple (a 4,000-year-old dyeing method that
  uses sea snails); Tānekaha Red (a traditional Māori dye derived from tree bark);
  and mauveine (the first synthetic dye—created from fossil fuels—and invented by
  a teenager in the 19th Century).\n\nPart 2 builds on students' understanding of
  these three dye technologies by challenging them to work together in groups to solve
  an engineering puzzle. They are given a set of 18 cards representing steps in a
  dyeing process. Students will figure out the correct sequence for all three dye
  technologies. Each step also has an associated cost, and students will add up the
  costs, calculate a starting price, and begin to reflect on the pros and cons of
  each technology. \n\nPart 3 puts students in the position of a chemical engineer
  who has to choose one of these technologies, taking into account a wide variety
  of factors. The presentation walks students through the interpretation of a graph
  showing how price scales with how many dyed items are being produced. They will
  develop data literacy, critical thinking, and communication skills as they interpret
  and discuss the various tradeoffs of each technology in terms of price, sustainability,
  cultural significance, and the ability to serve the demands of everyone. Ultimately,
  this lesson aims to broaden students’ conception of what technology is and to better
  understand the value of engineering, whether or not they decide to pursue it as
  a career.\n"

Extensions: |-
  - Have students read and discuss the scientific paper about dye technologies [in the Background Section](#background). This paper is co-authored by Māori weaving expert and conservator Rangi Te Kanawa, PhD.
  - Teach the [Black is Back](https://instructionalseries.tki.org.nz/Instructional-Series/Connected/Connected-2014-level-4-What-s-the-Evidence/Black-is-Back) lesson centred on Rangi’s conservatory work restoring Māori garments that were dyed using a different technology.
  - Have students research the significance of the pepeha in Māori culture. They can create their own using this [great online tool](https://pepeha.nz/create-pepeha).
  - Ask students to research chemical engineering, process engineering, chemistry, and related careers to find out median salary, school requirements, etc. A great resource is the [NZ Careers Website](https://www.careers.govt.nz/jobs-database/engineering/engineering/chemical-engineer/).
  - Have students watch this video about [bioengineering dyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIv25InZYig) and conduct independent research. For example, they could find a company developing sustainable dyes and make a presentation about why this company deserves investment, compared to others.
  - Have students research [Rangi Te Kanawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangi_Te_Kanawa), her mother [Diggeress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diggeress_Te_Kanawa), and grandmother [Rangimārie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangim%C4%81rie_Hetet), and to reflect on the significance of preserving indigenous technologies.

  here are some helpful links.\n- [Written Māori pronunciation guide](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/maori-hub/ako/te-reo-at-university/te-reo-maori-pronunciation-guide)

  \n#### Scientific Background\nThis lesson helps build a high-level understanding
  of the different processes behind 3 dye technologies: 2 derived from natural resources
  (tānekaha red and Tyrian purple) and 1 derived from fossil fuels (mauveine). You
  and your students can gain more detailed knowledge by reading this scientific paper,
  coauthored by Rangi Te Kanawa.\n![Screenshot of the journal article](paper.png)\n-
